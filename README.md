KOSS task:This project comprises a web server which enables a web site in which you can organize your tasks, list them as important, cross them off after being completed, add more tasks & delete existing tasks. Along with this, you can also create a grocery list and notes regarding your tasks. To run this project, download the repository on your remote device and run main.rs, run "127.0.0.1:7877" -port on any web browser â€“ your personal task manager will appear. 
In this project due to time constraints, I have created the most basic web server (that doesn't even include error) but runs an HTML file. This rust server works on port 127.0.0.1:7877 (section before the colon is an IP address representing your computer) 7877 is my port server's only response 200/ok.
My HTML file consist of proper HTML, CSS and JavaScript code. I have created a function in JS for proper functioning although I had to hardcode the function multiple times for different tabs because I wasn't able to get a hang of the 'This' keyword. In due time, I will change my code and make it more efficient. HTML and CSS in my project is upto the mark.
