In this project due to time constrain I have created the most basic web server (that doesn't even include error) but run an HTML file
this rust server works on port 127.0.0.1:7877 (section before the colon is an IP address representing your computer) 7877 is my port
server only response 200/ok 

My HTML file consist of proper HTML, CSS and JavaScript code
I have created function in JS for proper functioning although I had to hard code fuction multiple time for different tabs because I wasn't able to get a hang of
'This' keyword , in due time I will change my code and make it more efficient.
HTML and CSS in my project is upto mark.
